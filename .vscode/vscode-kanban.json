        "content": "- A `Lease` is the exclusive usage of a `Site` by a `Tenant` for a limited period of time (the `Term`).\n- A `Lease` is \"active\" when the `Term` of the `Lease` is cur`rent`. \n- A `Site` can have multiple `Lease` associated with it, but the `Term` of the `Lease`s cannot overlap, ie a `Site` can only have one \"active\" `Lease` at a time. \n- When a `Site` has no \"active\" `Lease` it is considered \"vacant\", and therefore \"leaseable\".\n- Each `Lease` tracks at least `Utility` payments and `Rent`. \n- A `Lease`, even while not \"active\", can have debt owing on it - `Utility` or `Rent`. \n- A `Tenant` can make a payment towards `Utility` or `Rent`.\n- `Utility` can accrue credit from over-payment, which is consumed to pay the next `Utility` bill.",
